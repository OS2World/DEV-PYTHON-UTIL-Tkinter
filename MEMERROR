This file contains information on a memory error that occurs in the OS/2
version of the Python interpreter.

The Visual Age malloc() function returns NULL if it is asked to allocate a
block of size 0.  To deal with this, it is necessary to add the following
line to the "config.h" in the PC/os2vacpp directory of the python source tree:

#define MALLOC_ZERO_RETURNS_NULL 1

The lack of this will cause a MemoryError in certain operations, including
copying an empty dictionary (something that the Tkinter code does quite
frequently).  To find out if your distribution has this problem, type
"{}.copy()" into the interpreter.  If you get a memory error, then it does.
